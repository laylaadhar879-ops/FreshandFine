I have used Canva to generate my mockup device response. The image shows the site on different devices, size screens and how my webpage adapts to the screens. I also used canva for my wireframe to layout the text and images in order to plan out the acceccibility of contents. For my icon, I seleceted an image with a transparent background from google images and used Favicon to generate the links in order for me to use it as an icon.

**Bootstrap**

Using bootstrap I have added a responsive nav section to all my pages and cards to my home page to showcase 'About us' information. In my second page I have used cards to create a product layout with its prices.

**Google Fonts**

For my primary font I have chosen to use Open Sans. 

- Uasgae: additional information, main body text and navigation links.

- Reasons: Easy to read, fits my layout and theme, has a professional look

For my seconday font I used DM Serif Display.

- Usage: For my headers and Branding.

- Reasons: Easy to read while adding depth and dimention, not too plain and i'm able to use it for my headers. Again fits the professional theme.

**Images and Videos**

I have chosen my video that I used for my hero section from canva. In the products page i personally created the images of the drinks through canva. 

All other pictures I have found on google images and I have included the source in my code. 

**Color Scheme**

This is the color pallete that I have Chosen for the Webpage

I chose these colors because they're bright and it captures the attention of the audiance. When they're layed out and used correctly they compliment eachother.
