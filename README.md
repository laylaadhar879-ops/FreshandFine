I have created a website for a family owened farm who want to advertise the fresh produce that is sourced from their farm. They want to showcase the bottled fruit juice that they have spent years working on trying to perfect it and make it suitable for everyone without adding any harmful ingredients.  

**Brief**

When the pageis loaded you are welcomed by the hero section, which containes a video of an orange tree with a heading of "welcome to fresh and fine". The button under the heading will lead you straight to the products page. As you scroll down there is an overall background information about the farm and as you scroll further you can select the category of your choice whcih will display more information. In the nav section 'home and about us' will lead you to this.The products page contains cards of different products and their prices. In the menu When you click the contact us it will lead you to the footer where you can see the different contact options and social media links. The sign up page allows viewers to sign up to recieve newsletter from the farm whcih could include any new products they sell, or just any general information that is updated or changed. When submitted they will be redirected to a thank you page to show completion .

I created the html files on vs code, created an assets folder and sub folders for videos, images and css. I then created my css file. I went to setting and created a repository called fresh and fine, i added the index.html file and started working on my code. I used Ai to help me with the grid layout and the ai auto complete that comes with vs code (emmet). After i was done with one section I commit it with git and Push the code. Half way through my project I decided to deploy the webpage, so i went to pages, selected the main branch, made it a public repository, added a readme file and deployed it. That way I could still work on it and see how it would look.

**Color Scheme**

This is the color pallete that I have Chosen for the Webpage

![Color Pallet](./extra/color-pallete.png)

I chose these colors because they're bright and it captures the attention of the audiance. When they're layed out and used correctly they compliment eachother.

I have used Canva to generate my mockup device response. The image shows the site on different devices, size screens and how my webpage adapts to the screens. I also used canva for my wireframe to layout the text and images in order to plan out the acceccibility of contents. For my icon, I seleceted an image with a transparent background from google images and used Favicon to generate the links in order for me to use it as an icon.
